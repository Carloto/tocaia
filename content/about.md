## Hey, I'm Vinicius Carloto

Full Stack Developer transitioning into Application Security.

I have 5+ years of experience building web applications with Node.js, TypeScript, React, and cloud platforms (AWS, Azure). Currently at System2, where I develop a fitness app with React Native and built AI-powered features using GPT and Langfuse.

Now I'm applying that same builder's mindset to security — learning how to break, test, and protect the systems I used to only build.

## What I'm focused on

- Web application security (OWASP Top 10, PortSwigger labs, CTFs)
- DevSecOps tooling (SAST/DAST, CI/CD security pipelines)
- AI/LLM security (prompt injection, RAG poisoning, guardrail bypass)
- Building security tools in Python and Go

## Why "Tocaia"?

*Tocaia* is a Tupi word meaning ambush — lying in wait, watching closely before striking. It felt like the right name for a blog about hunting vulnerabilities.
